Know Your Customer
==================

A web application that shows the analysis on the people visiting a particular store to make purchases. Each customer is uniquely identified using a non-intrusive technique. The customer's purchase history can be tracked to identify the behavior and buying trends. Algorithms are used to effectively identify brands and promote these brands to the customers. 

We track the Social Media activity too for the particular customer and target select customers for brand consumption, campaigns etc.

Retailers can leverage the real-time data to understand consumer buying patterns.
